# IntentPay: Universal DeFi Access with USDC
   
**IntentPay** is a revolutionary gasless wallet Mini App built on the **World App** platform that enables seamless cross-chain USDC transactions and intent-based trading. By combining Circle's Modular wallet technology and 1inch's advanced trading infrastructure, users can execute transactions without worrying about gas fees while being verified as unique humans through World ID.

## Vision

IntentPay transforms the crypto experience by providing a unified platform where users can **buy and participate in any token and DeFi protocol with USDC**. Our dual integration approach creates a seamless multi-chain financial ecosystem:

- **1inch Stream**: Utilizing Fusion for gasless swaps, Class Swap for cross-chain trading, Dev Portal APIs for deep liquidity access, and Portfolio Tracking for comprehensive asset management

This dual-stream approach allows users to move seamlessly between chains, swap tokens efficiently, and participate in DeFi - all with the simplicity of USDC and no gas fee management.
