# IntentPay

[](https://github.com/IntentPay/intent-pay/tree/develop-world/assets/IntentPay_banner.png)
**IntentPay** is a gasless wallet Mini App built on the **World App** platform that enables seamless USDC-priced, cross-chain transactions and intent-based trading. Powered by Circle's Modular wallet technology and 1inch's API, users can execute transactions through World App payments without worrying about gas fees while being verified as unique humans through World ID.

## Vision

**IntentPay** empowers World App's user base with a modern, gasless crypto wallet experience. By combining:

- **Circle's Modular Wallet** for secure, non-custodial wallet infrastructure
- **1inch API** for optimal trading and liquidity aggregation
- **World ID verification and World App payments** for Sybil-resistance, human verification, and seamless payments

We create a frictionless financial experience that removes the complexity of gas fees and wallet management while ensuring security and efficiency for all users.

## Core Features

- **USDC-Priced Cross-Chain Swaps**: All transactions priced in USDC regardless of destination chain or token
- **World App Payment Integration**: Pay for swaps directly through World App without connecting personal wallets
- **QR Code Address Scanning**: Easily input recipient addresses by scanning QR codes
- **Gasless Transactions**: Execute transfers without managing gas fees using IntentPay's official Circle wallet
- **Intent-Based Trading**: Submit trade intentions that get executed optimally via 1inch
- **Human Verification**: Privacy-preserving verification using World ID and zero-knowledge proofs
- **Multi-chain Support**: Transact across multiple blockchains seamlessly
- **Enhanced Security**: Passkey authentication and risk-based transaction screening
- **Portfolio Tracking**: View balances and transaction history across supported chains

## Technical Architecture
